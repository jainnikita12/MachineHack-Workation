Tried :
    Feature Engineering
    SQL queries

    Data feature extraction based on Correlation
    
    
    
Next, I repeated all the above steps except feature selection, which are:
Loading the data
Removing the unwanted columns
Encoding the categorical variable
Splitting the data into train and test set
Fitting the data to the model
Making the predictions and calculating the accuracy
